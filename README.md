# Dynamic-simulation-of-jib-crane-with-payload-attachment
- This project aims at creating a signal-based math-model in Simulink and componentbased physical model in Simscape for simulating the hanging load system and verifying the results of these simulations by comparing with each other. The verification results, MatLab code description is discussed in detail in this project.
- In this project, the differential equations of the system are derived using Lagrangian method. Those differential equations are used in signal-based simulink model for simulating the system and calculating the desired outputs.
- Furthermore, the component-based model is constructed which does not require formulation of differential equations.
- The results of both models are compared to ensure that the equations formed are correctly representing the kinematics of the system.
- For creating the models, the buses and variant sub-systems of Simulink are used. The information about these is also provided in the project report.
- The simulation is verified for first scenario of inputs. The verification is justified by providing the numerical values of maximum errors involved between two models.
- At last, there are certain recommendations included for the future improvement in the model to make it more realistic.
